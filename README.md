# IPL First Innings Score Predictor

## Project Overview
This project uses Machine Learning to predict the score of an IPL team in the first innings.

## Dataset
I used historical IPL data (2008-2019) containing ball-by-ball information.
- **File:** `ipl.csv`

## How it works
1. Loads the dataset.
2. Filters data for the first innings.
3. Uses algorithms like Linear Regression to predict the final total based on current runs, wickets, and overs.
